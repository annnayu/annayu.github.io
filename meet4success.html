        <h1>The Problem </h1>
        <p>University of Toronto students are unsure of where to turn to for career advice. While, University of Toronto alumni want to support students but need an experience that fits into their busy schedules.</p>
        <h1>Our Objective</h1>
        <p>How can we improve student and alumni experiences within University of Toronto mentorship programs?</p>
        <h1>Our Approach</h1>
        <p>We implemented a design-thinking process to create a solution that would provide the best experience for University of Toronto students and alumni.</p>

        <p>1. Empathize </p>
        <p>User Research</p>
        <p>In order to understand the current mentorship space and its users, our team conducted preliminary and competitive analysis on mentorship experiences at the University of Toronto (U of T) and elsewhere.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/Meet4Success - Purple Background.svg">
        <p>Major Findings</p>
        <img style="width:41px;" src="assets/images/Meet4Success_number1.png">
        <p>Existing U of T mentorship programs are siloed within individual faculties or programs.</p>
        <img style="width:41px;" src="assets/images/Meet4Success_number2.png">
        <p>Competitors include: Linkedin, Shapr, and Bumble Bizz</p>
        <img style="width:41px;" src="assets/images/Meet4Success_number3.png">
        <p>No consistent process for students or alumni to become a mentee, and the requirements and steps vary depending on faculty.</p>
        <h1>User Interviews & Surveys</h1>
        <p>To understand the obstacles students and alumni were facing with mentorship, we conducted 16 individual interviews and an online survey with 34 respondents.
        </p>
        <img style="width:478px;" src="assets/images/Meet4Success_quote1.png">

        <h1>Key Takeaways from our User Research </h1>
        <p> Once we collected our data, we created an affinity map and clustered similar responses to identify common themes.

        <img style="width:64px;" src="assets/images/Meet4Success - TAKEAWAY_awareness.svg">
        <p>Insufficient mentorship awareness</p>
        <p>A majority of students and alumni were unaware of mentorship programs offered by the University of Toronto.
        </p>
        <p>Many didn’t know where to look if they wanted to get involved and didn’t understand what the matching process and time commitment would consist of.</p>

        <img style="width:64px;" src="assets/images/Meet4Success - TAKEAWAY_honycomb.svg">
        <p>Lack of structure and purpose</p>
        <p>Students and alumni both wanted clear and defined goals in their mentorship experience. </p>
        <p>Many times, both parties are left unsure about the meeting goal, and unaware of each others expectations.</p>
        <img style="width:64px;" src="assets/images/Meet4Success - TAKEAWAY_like.svg">
        <p>Both students and alumni expressed that they see value and can benefit from a mentee-mentor experience. </p>
        <p>Students specifically wanted advice on career development, while alumni wanted to develop leadership skills while giving back to the community.</p>
        <img style="width:64px;" src="assets/images/Meet4Success - TAKEAWAY_userpreference.svg">
        <p>Nearly all respondents mentioned they see more value in 1-on-1 mentorships.</p>
        <p>Users emphasized the importance of having one point of contact. Group mentorship programs were described negatively and as disorganized.</p>

        <p>2. Define</p>
        <h1>Narrowing down the scope</h1>
        <p>With all the information we’ve gathered through research, we narrowed down our goal and defined the direction we wanted to pursue through empathy mapping, user personas, and as-is scenarios. We began with empathy mapping to help us understand
            how U of T students and alumni truly think, feel, do, and say. This information was further synthesized into user personas. </p>

        <p>Meet the users</p>
        <p>Considering our design challenge involves two user types: the student and the alumni, we created two separate user personas. I created the visuals of these personas and assisted with the content. </p>

        <p>We looked at their current mentorship experience</p>
        <p>Now that we’ve identified Susan and Andy, we created an as-is scenario for each user to help us visually see their current journey and identify pain points and areas of opportunities. </p>

        <h1>Sparking Ideas</h1>
        <p>Once we refined the goal for the project, we generated 30 ideas to address Susan the student and Andy the alumni’s needs and obstacles. With dot voting, we narrowed it down to 15 ideas. </p>
        <img style="width:1182px;" src="assets/images/Meet4Success - STICKYS.png">
        <p>Priorization Grid</p>
        <p>We organized these 15 ideas into a prioritization grid to determine the most impactful and most feasible ideas to help tackle mentor-mentee mentorship at U of T. I drew the doodles to go along with each idea for better visualization.

        <img style="width:1169px;" src="assets/images/Meet4Success - PRIORIZATION TABLE.png">
        <p>With the introduction of Meet4Success, let’s see how Susan and Andy’s mentorship experience will differ.</p>
        <p>Below I visualized the to-be scenario to identify whether the introduction of the Meet4Success app will leave a positive impact on Susan and Andy’s existing mentorship experience.</p>

        <p>The next goal was to identify any gaps in our knowledge, overlooked issues, and friction points with the decisions made so far. Guerrilla testing with 3 representative users helped us prepare for the next round of iterations.

        <p>Reflection</p>
        <p>Without research, you’ll lack a strong product design foundation.</p>
        <p>Throughout this project I’ve come to learn the significance of gathering the right data from our target users. Without it, it would’ve been hard to avoid being biased and difficult to justify our design decisions. As our product came to fruition,
            I witnessed the positive impacts of completing thorough research and how it led us to create a product far from what I initially envisioned.</p>
